# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?.  If you skimp in this section expect to be marked down in your grade. Paint a picture of the project a couple of paragraphs is expected!-->

A new  preventative vaccine (covid91) is under test in clinical trials. Given the nature of this vaccine it is suspected that the drug may exhibit different effectiveness across the variety of subpopulations tracked. Consider population subgroups by gender( guys and gals), drug use, and sexual orientation. Write a complete report that separately considers this drug for each subgroup and your recommendations as to whether people in the subgroup should take the vaccine.

### Data For Guys

```{r}
guysData <- filter(FinalData,sex=="guy")
``` 
```{r}
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=guysData)
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=guysData, type="percent")
```
According to this graph, the drug is not effective on guys. More guys that tool the drug contracted Covid than those who took the placebo.

# Numerical Summaries for Guys 

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=guysData)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```
it shows that %58 of guys that contracted Covid had taken the vaccine as opposed to the %42 that took the placebo. 

# Inferential for Guys

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```
According to this test the odds are roughly 1.5:1 which, are not very good odds. Meaning you have a higher chance of contracting it if you are a guy taking the vacine instead of the placebo. 

### Data For Gals

```{r}
galsData <- filter(FinalData,sex=="gal")
```
```{r}
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=galsData)
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=galsData, type="percent")
```
According the graph, Those women who took the placebo contracted Covid at a higher rate. Meaning the drug was more effective on women than the placebo. About %64 percent of the placebo takers contracted covid.  where only about %34 percent of the drug takers got sick.

# Numerical Summaries for Gals 

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=galsData)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```
We can see that %67 of the gals who contacted covid had taken the placebo, whereas %33 percent of them had taken the drug. 

# Inferential for gals

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```
According to the results of the fisher exact test, you have  .5:1 odds of conrtacting covid while using the drug. Meaning you are less likely to contract Covid while using the drug making it more effective for women. 


### Data For Drug users
```{r}
DrugData <- filter(FinalData,DrugUser=="yes")
```
```{r}
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=DrugData)
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=DrugData, type="percent")
```
These results are similar to the ones for the Gals. More drug users who contracted covid were not on the drug and used the placebo. 

###  Numerical Summaries for Drug Users 

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=DrugData)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
``` 
We can see that %67 of the drug users that contracted covid were using a placebo. Whereas %33 of them were using the vaccine. Meaning the vaccine was more effective on drug users in not contracting covid. 

## Inferential for Drug Users

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```
The odds of contracting covid while on the drug are .5:1 which means you are less likely to contract covid while using the drug if you are a drug user. 



### LGBTQ+
```{r}
lgbtqData <- filter(FinalData,LGBTQ=="gay")
```
```{r}
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=lgbtqData)
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=lgbtqData, type="percent")
```
This chart shows a little more drastic than the guys. Of the subjects who contracted covid, more of them were on the drug as opposed to the placebo. Roughly %70 of them were on the drug.

### Numerical Summaries for LGBTQ 

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=lgbtqData)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```
Of the people who identify as LGBTQ+ that contracted Covid, roughly %71 of them were on the drug. Showing the drug was ineffective in preventing Covid. 

## Inferential for LGBTQ

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```
According to these results. The odds of contracting covid while on the drug, if you identify as LGBTQ+ is around 2.5:1 which is the highest rate of the ones we've discussed. 


# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->


After looking at the data, If you are a male on the drug, you have a higher chance of covid than if you take a placebo, which i would suggest not taking the drug.

If you are a female on the drug, you have a much hihgh chance of not contracting Covid based on the data, so it would be safer to take the drug than not.

The same suggestion if you are a frequent drug user. You have a much lower chance of contracting covid if you are on this drug. 

However, I would strongly advise to not use this drug if you identify as LGBTQ+, you are more likely to contract covid while using this drug.

# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?.  If you skimp in this section expect to be marked down in your grade. Paint a picture of the project a couple of paragraphs is expected!-->

A new  preventative vaccine (covid91) is under test in clinical trials. Given the nature of this vaccine it is suspected that the drug may exhibit different effectiveness across the variety of subpopulations tracked. Consider population subgroups by gender( guys and gals), drug use, and sexual orientation. Write a complete report that separately considers this drug for each subgroup and your recommendations as to whether people in the subgroup should take the vaccine.

#Guys

```{r}
guysData <- filter(FinalData,sex=="guy")
``` 
```{r}
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=guysData)
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=guysData, type="percent")
```
According to this graph, the drug is not effective on guys. More guys that tool the drug contracted Covid than those who took the placebo.

# Numerical Summaries for Guys 

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=guysData)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```
it shows that %58 of guys that contracted Covid had taken the vaccine as opposed to the %42 that took the placebo. 

# Inferential for Guys

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```
According to this test the odds are roughly 1.5:1 which, are not very good odds. Meaning you have a higher chance of contracting it if you are a guy taking the vacine instead of the placebo. 

#gals

```{r}
galsData <- filter(FinalData,sex=="gal")
```
```{r}
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=galsData)
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=galsData, type="percent")
```
According the graph, Those women who took the placebo contracted Covid at a higher rate. Meaning the drug was more effective on women than the placebo. About %64 percent of the placebo takers contracted covid.  where only about %34 percent of the drug takers got sick.

#Numerical Summaries for Gals 

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=galsData)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```
We can see that %67 of the gals who contacted covid had taken the placebo, whereas %33 percent of them had taken the drug. 

# Inferential for gals

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```
According to the results of the fisher exact test, you have  .5:1 odds of conrtacting covid while using the drug. Meaning you are less likely to contract Covid while using the drug making it more effective for women.

# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method. Discuss what data manipulations may be needed for example subsetting or other binning procedures and what sort of graphical displays and inferential tools will be used!-->

# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->



# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->
